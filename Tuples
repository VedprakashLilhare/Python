#Python Tuples
a=("b","c","d","e")
print(a)
      #output:('b','c','d','e') 
      ğŸ‘‰Tuples are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change, add or remove items after the tuple has been created.
         but this is way to changeğŸ‘‡
#Change Tuple Values
  x = (1,2,3,4,5)
  y = list(x)
  y[1] = "a"
  x = tuple(y)
  print(x)
       #output:(1,'a',3,4,5)
